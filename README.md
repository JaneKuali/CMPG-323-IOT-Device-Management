Implementing architectural and design pattern principles

## About
There different types of Design Patterns and Stardard that may be used when creating an Application. This Web App specifically makes use of the Repository Pattern.
With the Repository Pattern - the database is not directly used by the controller to minimize the potential of the repetitive code. This means that the use of interfaces
and classes to instantiate possible repetitive code is found in these interfaces and classes. Then, all that the different entities do is just inherit and impliment the 
code as needed.
